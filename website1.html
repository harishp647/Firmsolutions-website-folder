Outsourcing your embedded software and database engineering offers significant advantages to in-house engineering, and Firm Solutions will achieve high-quality, efficient, and speedy results compared to in-house engineering and other outsourcing firms.


<h2>Why outsource your engineering tasks?</h2>

<ul> <li>Focus: Contract engineers offer total commitment to the engineering requirements of that specific project. Our focus is the development of new products and features. Your needs become our number one goal, without the distractions of extra projects and maintenance of other company areas.</li>

	<li>Cost: Outsourced specialized embedded software, user experience, and database engineers have the depth of technical expertise you need without requiring you to hire full-time engineers, pull workers from other important projects, or worry about retaining employees between projects, saving total cost of ownership of the product.</li>

	<li>Speed to market: Consulting engineers focus solely on the project, and possess a greater breadth of experience, the latest training, and knowledge of both proven and emerging technologies and architectures than in-house engineers. They can choose the fastest and most efficient method of implementation, allowing you to gain market share rapidly with minimal investment.</li>

	<li>Retain IP in-house: Our engineers provide a discrete and fully-documented finished product. They train your stuff in support, and provide maintenance and updates without imposing on in-house work schedules.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Why choose Firm Solutions?</h2>

<ul> <li>We have years of experience and a proven track record of providing timely, efficient and complete solutions to our clients.</li>

<li>Our client success stories are in a wide variety of industries and technologies, and we can provide references from prior clients, including case studies showing how our solutions can make a difference in your industry.</li>

<li>	We pride ourselves on quick turn-around, with a focus on efficiently carrying out your specific needs.</li>

<li>	We make sure that we communicate with you to provide comprehensive updates, and a responsible senior staff member oversees the development process, regulates risks, eliminates points of failure, and provides timely decision-making.</li>

<li>	Our diverse and multicultural engineering force, with degrees from elite American and international educational institutions, gives us the ability to complete engineering tasks in-house while preserving, if needed, the benefits of improved communication with out-of-country contractors and clients.</li>
